This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using Python’s Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The game features a 3x3 grid of buttons, where two players, “X” and “O”, take turns clicking on the buttons to make their moves. The current player alternates between “X” and “O” each time a button is clicked. When a button is clicked, it updates to show the current player’s symbol.

Key Features:

	•	Graphical Interface: The game uses a visual grid made up of buttons where players can click to place their mark.
	•	Player Alternation: After each move, the player’s turn alternates between “X” and “O”.
	•	Interactive Gameplay: Each button can be clicked only once, and it changes to display the player’s symbol.
